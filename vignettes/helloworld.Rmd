Put simply, a shinytableau extension is a specially structured Shiny app. (If you haven't written a Shiny app before, you're *definitely* going to want to go through the [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/), at the very least, before attempting to go further with shinytableau.)

Let's start by creating the simplest possible Tableau extension: one that will display the string `"Hello, world!"`. First, create a new, empty RStudio project (File \| New Project... \| New Directory \| New Project).

Then call:

``` {.r}
shinytableau::yaml_skeleton()
```

This will create an example `manifest.yml` file in your project, which controls the metadata that is displayed to Tableau users when they install the extension.

Besides the obvious fields like name, description, and author, you'll also want to change the `extension_id` to a value unlikely to be used by anyone else, e.g. replacing `com.example` with your company's [reverse domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation).

Next, create a file called `app.R` in this directory, and make it look like the following:

```{r code=readLines(system.file("examples/tutorial-1/app.R", package = "shinytableau")), eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
```

If you've written a Shiny app before, this code should look comfortingly familiar. The main differences are the `manifest` object, the `ui` being wrapped in `function(req) {...}` (optional in a regular Shiny app, but mandatory here), and where the last line is usually `shinyApp(ui, server)` we instead have `tableau_extension(manifest, ui, server)`.

There are two other small differences worth noting. First, the file starts with the comment:

``` {.r}
# filetype: shinyApp
```

This is a hint to the RStudio IDE that even though the file doesn't look like a Shiny app (because it doesn't end with `shinyApp(ui, server)`), it actually is.

Second, the call to `tableau_extension` includes a hardcoded port number. For local development purposes, it's a good idea to hardcode the port to a unique value (between 1025 and 49151) for each extension that you create.

Now, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter (or Cmd+Shift+Return on Mac) and you should see the info page for this extension appear. Download the .trex file, drag an Extension onto a Tableau dashboard, choose the .trex file, and you should see "Hello, world!" in your dashboard.
