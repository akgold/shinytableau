Put simply, a shinytableau extension is a specially structured Shiny app. (If you haven't written a Shiny app before, you're *definitely* going to want to go through the [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/), at the very least, before attempting to go further with shinytableau.)

Let's start by creating the simplest possible Tableau extension: one that will display the string `"Hello, world!"`. First, create a new, empty RStudio project using _File > New Project... > New Directory > New Project_.

## Create extension manifest

Once RStudio has opened your new project, run this command from the R console:

``` {.r}
shinytableau::yaml_skeleton()
```

This will create an example `manifest.yml` file in your project, which controls the metadata that is displayed to Tableau users when they install the extension. Take a moment to customize its contents to fit your extension.

Besides the obvious fields like name, description, and author, you'll also want to change the `extension_id` to a value unlikely to be used by anyone else, e.g. replacing `com.example` with your company's [reverse domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation).

## Create extension Shiny app

Next, create a file called `app.R` in this directory, and make it look like the following:

```{r code=readLines(system.file("examples/tutorial-1/app.R", package = "shinytableau")), eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
```

If you've written a Shiny app before, this code should look comfortingly familiar. The main differences are the `manifest` object, the `ui` being wrapped in `function(req) {...}` (optional in a regular Shiny app, but mandatory here), and where the last line is usually `shinyApp(ui, server)` we instead have `tableau_extension(manifest, ui, server)`.

There are two other small differences worth noting. First, the file starts with the comment:

``` {.r}
# filetype: shinyApp
```

This is a hint to the RStudio IDE that even though the file doesn't look like a Shiny app (because it doesn't end with `shinyApp(ui, server)`), it actually is.

Second, the call to `tableau_extension` includes a hardcoded port number. For local development purposes, it's a good idea to hardcode the port to a unique value (between 1025 and 49151) for each extension that you create.

## Running and using extensions

Now, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter (or Cmd+Shift+Return on Mac) and you should see the info page for this extension appear.

Click the _Download_ button to download the .trex file.

Next, go to your Tableau dashboard, and drag an Extension object onto it; from the dialog that appears, click _My Extensions_. This will launch a file chooser. Pick the .trex file you downloaded, and you should see "Hello, world!" in your dashboard.

Now that you've seen the basic structure of a shinytableau extension, we'll show you how you can add a configuration dialog to your extension so that Tableau users can customize it to their needs.
