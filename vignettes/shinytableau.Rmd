Tableau version 2020.3 introduced a new extensibility feature called Dashboard Extensions. This feature lets programmers use JavaScript to create custom objects that normal Tableau users can drop into their Tableau dashboard layouts, providing custom visualizations and interactive features beyond Tableau's native capabilities.

The {shinytableau} package allows you to easily create Tableau dashboard extensions using the power of R and Shiny. In typical Shiny fashion, it's not necessary to know web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create compelling Tableau extensions.

## Example: Violin plot

At the time of this writing, Tableau doesn't have built-in support for [violin plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot), only [box plots](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_boxplot.htm). While box plots are more familiar, violin plots are more informative because they show you the entire distribution instead of merely quartiles. For example, the plots below show TODO:

I would be remiss not to mention the heroics that Tableau consultant Gwilym Lockwood went through to [create a violin plot in Tableau](https://gwilymlockwood.com/2018/07/03/language-sex-violins-other-how-to-create-violin-plots-in-tableau/). The blog post is worth a read, but the takeaway is that you'd have to *really* want a violin plot to go through all of those steps.

In R, on the other hand, there are several packages that provide violin plots; a cursory search turned up [vioplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vioplot/vignettes/violin_customisation.html), [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/violin/), [ggpubr](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggviolin.html), and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html). Here's how you might create a violin plot in ggplot2, using the `mtcars` data set, showing the horsepower (`hp`) distribution for each cylinder count (`cyl`):

```{r warning=FALSE,fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = hp)) +
  geom_violin()
```

With shinytableau, we can wrap this R code into an easy-to-use Tableau dashboard extension that can be used by Tableau users that don't even know what R is. They don't need to modify the code to point to the data source and variables they want to plot, because you're going to provide them with a GUI for that. They don't need to think about how to configure R on their server, because you can deploy it just once for all users of the extension.

Take a look at what it's like to use a shinytableau extension:

To recap:

1.  Navigate to the shinytableau extension's info page and click Download to save a .trex file to your hard drive.
2.  In a Tableau dashboard, drag an Extension object from the sidebar to the dashboard.
3.  Select "My Extensions", and choose the .trex file you just downloaded. (It's now safe to delete that .trex file, or keep it for the next time you want to install that extension.)
4.  Choose "Configure" from the down-arrow menu from the border of the extension object.

You (and other Tableau users) can use the same shinytableau extension across multiple dashboards. And just as a single Tableau dashboard can contain multiple (e.g.) bar chart sheets, each with its own view of the data, you can also have one shinytableau extension appear multiple times in a dashboard, with each instance configured differently.

We'll come back to violin plots later, but let's look at some much simpler examples first.

## Writing your first extension

Put simply, a shinytableau extension is a specially structured Shiny app. (If you haven't written a Shiny app before, you're *definitely* going to want to go through the [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/), at the very least, before attempting to go further with shinytableau.)

Let's start by creating the simplest possible Tableau extension: one that will display the string `"Hello, world!"`. First, create a new, empty RStudio project (File \| New Project... \| New Directory \| New Project).

Then call:

``` {.r}
shinytableau::yaml_skeleton()
```

This will create an example `manifest.yml` file in your project, which controls the metadata that is displayed to Tableau users when they install the extension. Besides the obvious fields like name, description, and author, you'll also want to change the `extension_id` to a value unlikely to be used by anyone else, e.g. replacing `com.example` with your company's [reverse domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation).

Next, create a file called `app.R` in this directory, and make it look like the following:

```{r code=readLines(system.file("examples/tutorial-1/app.R", package = "shinytableau")), eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
```

If you've written a Shiny app before, this code should look comfortingly familiar. The main differences are the `manifest` object, the `ui` being wrapped in `function(req) {...}` (optional in a regular Shiny app, but mandatory here), and where the last line is usually `shinyApp(ui, server)` we now do `tableau_extension(manifest, ui, server)`.

There are two other small differences worth noting. First, the file starts with the comment `# filetype: shinyApp`; this is a hint to the RStudio IDE that even though the file doesn't look like a Shiny app (because it doesn't end with `shinyApp(ui, server)`), it actually is. Second, the call to `tableau_extension` includes a hardcoded port number. For local development purposes, it's a good idea to hardcode the port to a unique value (between 1025 and 49151) for each extension.

Now, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter (or Cmd+Shift+Return on Mac) and you should see the info page for this extension appear. Download the .trex file, drag an Extension onto a Tableau dashboard, choose the .trex file, and you should see "Hello, world!" in your dashboard.

## Adding configuration settings

Now we'll see how configuration works by making our tiny extension only slightly more complex: instead of showing the hardcoded string "Hello, world!" we'll allow the dashboard author to specify who is being greeted.

We will use a configuration dialog to prompt the dashboard author for the greetee[^1], save their input as a setting called `"greetee"`, and have the extension use that setting to dynamically render the greeting.

[^1]: Yes, it's a [real word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/greetee)!

```{r code=readLines(system.file("examples/tutorial-2/app.R", package = "shinytableau")), eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
```

If your RStudio session is still running the previous version of the code we wrote, stop it now by either clicking in the Console pane and hitting Escape, or pressing the stop-sign icon in the Console toolbar. Then run the new code with Ctrl+Shift+Enter/Cmd+Shift+Return.

You should see something like the following screenshot: the extension object shows only the name of the extension, and a message that you need to configure the extension.

![](tutorial-2a.png){width="573"}

Clicking Configure shows a text input:

![](tutorial-2b.png){width="421"}

Type in a value and click OK, and you should see the extension object instantly update to reflect your change.

![](tutorial-2c.png){width="573"}

Compared to the "Hello, World!" version, we've made a number of important changes.

Most obviously, we now have `config_ui` and `config_server`, which together represent the configuration dialog. These two variables are passed to `tableau_extension` as the next two arguments after `ui` and `server`.

The job of `config_ui`/`config_server` is to take input about the user's preferences (in this case, what message should be displayed), and save them as *settings*. Each extension instance has its own set of settings; that is, if the same extension is dropped on a dashboard three times, then there are three extension instances, each with their own completely independent config dialogs and settings.

There are several essential requirements for `config_ui` and `config_server` that you need to know about.

#### config\_ui

As we said about `ui` above, `config_ui` needs to be a `function(req) { ... }` that returns some UI object, not just the UI object itself as you can do in a normal Shiny app.

Also, most Shiny `ui` (including shinytableau ones) should have a `fluidPage`, `fillPage`, or other page function as their outermost call, but this isn't the case with `config_ui`. The UI you return from `config_ui` will be inserted into a configuration dialog UI that shinytableau creates for you. So instead of `fillPage()`, use `tagList()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
config_ui <- function(req) {
  tagList(
    textInput("greetee", "Whom would you like to greet?", "world")
  )
}
```

#### config\_server

There are two new requirements for `config_server` versus a regular `server`. First, a normal Shiny `server` is a function that takes `input`, `output`, and `session` arguments; a `config_server` takes an additional `iv` argument. This represents an `InputValidator` object from the [shinyvalidate](https://rstudio.github.io/shinyvalidate/articles/shinyvalidate.html) package. You use `iv` to tell shinytableau which user inputs *must* be provided, and any validation rules that must be enforced. Any required inputs that are missing, or failing validation rules, will display errors in the form and prevent the OK and Apply buttons from taking effect.

Second, a `config_server` function must declare a `save_settings` function, and must return this function. This is in contrast to regular Shiny server functions, which do not return anything[^2]. The `save_settings` function should take no arguments and, when called, should call [`update_tableau_settings_async`](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytableau/reference/update_tableau_settings_aync.html) to persist whatever settings the user has specified. In this case, we're taking the user input, `input$greetee`, and persisting that as a setting named `greetee`.

[^2]: Although Shiny *module* server functions often do return objects to their callers.

```{r eval=FALSE}
config_server <- function(input, output, session, iv) {
  # Ensure that the user provides a value for input$greetee
  iv$add_rule("greetee", sv_required())

  # config_server must have a save_settings function
  save_settings <- function() {
    update_tableau_settings_async(
      greetee = input$greetee
    )
  }
  
  # config_server must always return the save_settings function
  return(save_settings)
}
```

(Advanced R users may be wondering if, rather than declaring and returning `save_settings`, simply having an anonymous function as the last expression would be sufficient. Yes, that works, but doing it the recommended way makes the intent more immediately obvious.)

The values you pass to `update_tableau_settings_async()` will be saved as JSON objects, so it's a good idea to keep things simple: atomic numeric, character, and logical vectors are safe to use, as are unnamed and named lists. `NULL` is fine too. It's not a good idea to save more specialized objects like factors, data frames, environments, R6 objects. Even Date objects should probably be converted to character first, and parsed back into a Date by whomever is reading the setting.

Speaking of reading settings...

### Reading settings

Now that we've discussed how `config_ui` and `config_server` can let you write settings, we can talk about the much simpler topic of how to read settings from the extension object (i.e. `server`).

The main way you'll access settings is by calling `tableau_setting(setting_name)`, e.g. `tableau_setting("greetee")` in the example above. The important thing to note is that `tableau_setting` performs a *reactive* read, so whomever is doing the reading (i.e. reactive expression, reactive observer, or reactive output) will be triggered when the setting changes.

You can call `tableau_settings_all()` to retrieve all of the current settings as a list. Generally you should try to use `tableau_setting` in favor of `tableau_settings_all`, because the latter takes a reactive dependency on *all* of the settings, even if you're not actually interested in all of them.
